## Well, you've reached the end...

Its time to say our farewells...

Farewell good student. I'll miss you.

There is one last thing you must do before you leave.

Since you can now create different terrains using the fancy `TerrainGenerator` class, your challenge is to create 2 new terrains and then make a post with screenshots of them (you can also include code if you want to).

You can look at what other students have made in the course's posts (click the post icon next to the chat icon) and get inspiration. Some students even show the code they used for their terrain (feel free to borrow their code and make it your own, I don't believe in plagarism). 

If you get stuck just jump right into the live chat and ask for help from me!

Remember the more you experiment and the more you push yourself the better you will become! If you plan on adding more features to the code, start with a very simple one that you know you can implement, so you don't feel discouraged. See ya!

> PS: Posts with a screenshot or video will be included in the "student work" section on the course's landing page!
