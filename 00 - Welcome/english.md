# Welcome to the voxels course!
In this course you will make the most awesome minecraft chunk ever (and most incomplete). After you finish this you can take the next course, that will cover multithreading and large world generation!

...But for now lets get the basics down. Plus this will be fun, I promise.

# Project Setup
In Unity Hub make sure to download Unity 2021.3.1f1 or later since that is what this course will be using.

Make a new Project in Unity Hub and name it "voxels-unity". Thats all the setup I have for you!

And finally if you want to help contribute to this course you can make a pull request to the [voxels-unity-course](https://github.com/PaperPrototype/voxels-unity-course) github repository.
