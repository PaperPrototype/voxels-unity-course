# Welcome to the voxels course!

In this course you will make a single editable minecraft chunk. We do this to keep things simple so you can get the basics down, before moving on to the more advanced courses that will cover world generation with many chunks as well as multithreading.

If you ever get stuck there is a live chat at the top right.

In Unity Hub make sure to download Unity 2021.3.1f1 or later since that is what this course will be using.

Make a new Project in Unity Hub and name it "voxels-unity". And thats all the setup we have!

As a teaser here is a video of what you will have built by the end of this course.

And finally if you want to help contribute to this course you can make a pull request to the [voxels-unity course github repository](https://github.com/PaperPrototype/voxels-unity-course).

Lets get on with it!
