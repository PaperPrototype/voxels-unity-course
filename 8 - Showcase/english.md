## Well, you've reached the end...

Its time to say our farewells...

Farewell good student. I'll miss you.

Although there is one last thing you must do before you leave.

Since you can now create different terrains using the fancy `TerrainGenerator` class, your challenge is to create 2 new terrains and then make a post with screenshots of them (you can also include code if you want to).

If you get stuck just jump right into the Discord and ask for help from me!

Remember the more you experiment and the more you push yourself the better you will become! If you plan on adding more features to the code, start with a very simple one that you know you can implement, so you don't feel discouraged. See ya!
