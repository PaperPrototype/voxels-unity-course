TODO
- update the voxel type system to have "layers" or "groups"

- voxels in same layer will consider eachother solid and combine with eachother, but consider other layers to be air 
	- 

- layers decide if their voxels will get a collision mesh or not?
	- by consequence each layer will have its own gameObject/layer per chunk
