Its showcase time! 

At the bottom of the page there is a "New Showcase Post" button.

First thing;s first you need a screenshot or youtube video for your post. If you have a youtube video you can embed it into your post by doing the following:

You have a challenge! DON DON DON. Yes this is very serious.

The challenge is... you must at least add 1 feature that is not from the course to the voxel terrain. Here are some ideas:
- add another transparent voxel type
- make a new property in the VoxelType.cs script called "shouldDraw", then you can make voxels "not solid" while still drawing their meshes (if your thinking why didn't we do that for water? Think again. I give you a hint: water blocks won't optimize with eachother, and won't be transparent).
- edit, or make your own, texture atlas!
- instantiate a gameObject prefab instead of meshing a voxel and have a `usePrefab` check in each voxel type.

There is definitely more ideas I haven't listed. You can also look at what other students made and get inspiration from them. Or if you are having trouble, jump in on the live chat and ask other poeple what they think!

Remember the more you experiment and the more you push yourself the better you will become! Although start with something simple that you know you can do, so you don't feel discoraged.

Once you add your own feature, make a new showcase post and tell us what new feature you added. You can also record a video of yourself explaining the new feature and show off what you made!

Posts with a screenshot or video will be included in the "student work" section on the course's landing page!
