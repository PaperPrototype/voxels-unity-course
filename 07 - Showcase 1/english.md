Its showcase time! 

At the bottom of the page there is a "New Showcase Post" button. Use that to make a new showcase post... but first things first you need a screenshot or youtube video for your post!

If you have a youtube video you can embed it into your post by doing the following:

```

```

Which would give:

If you have a picture you can upload it to imgur.com (twitter is also a good option), and then paste the image link like this:

```

```

Which would give:

# Challenge
You also have a challenge to complete!

You must at least add 1 of the following features or your own feature (that is not from the course).
- add another transparent voxel type
- make a new property in the VoxelType.cs script called "shouldDraw", then you can make voxels "not solid" while still drawing their meshes 
	- (if you're thinking "why didn't we do that for water?" Think again. I'll give you a hint: water blocks wouldn't optimize with eachother, and wouldn't be transparent).
- edit, or make your own, texture atlas!
- instantiate a gameObject prefab instead of creating a voxel (add a `usePrefab` variable in each voxel type, as well as a GameObject `prefab` variable).
-  Change the `GetVoxelType` method to create different terrains! (you must at least make 2 different terrains and take screenshots if you choose this)

You can look at what other students have made in the course's posts (click the post icon next to the chat icon) and get inspiration. If you get stuck just jump right in to the live chat and ask for help from me!

Remember the more you experiment and the more you push yourself the better you will become! If you plan on doing multiple features, start with a very simple one that you know you can implement, so you don't feel discouraged.

Once you add your own feature, make a new showcase post and tell us what new feature you added. You can also record a video of yourself explaining the new feature and show off what you made!

(PS: Posts with a screenshot or video will be included in the "student work" section on the course's landing page!)
